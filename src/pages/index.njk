<h1>Devar-TTY</h1>

<p>Media personality Rob “Devar-TTY” Kalajian has been a staple in the board game world for many years. Dev now focuses mostly on video games and TTRPGs. A self-proclaimed geek, Dev loves all things toys and games and even helps raise his four kids in his spare time.</p>

<h2>Team Expiration</h2>

<p>Just because we expire a lot in online games doesn't mean we have an expiration date.</p>

<p>Team Expiration is a group of "older" gamers looking to play their favorite online games in a friendly environment even though their skills may have gotten a bit rusty over the years.</p>

<p>We also fundraise for Extra Life, so checkout our <a href="https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donordrive.team&teamID=60075" target="_blank">team page</a> and make a donation to help some kiddos.</p>

<h2>A Safe Space</h2>

<p>This site, along with my <a href="https://discord.gg/PRjtw9B" target="_blank">Discord channel</a> and social media feeds, are Safe Spaces. I do not tolerate violence, harassment, or hate speech. I welcome all marginalized people with an open heart.</p>

<h2>You Are Welcome At My Table</h2>

<p><em>Supporting inclusivity in gaming</em></p>

<a href="https://yamamt.threadless.com" target="_blank">You Are Welcome At My Table</a>, or #youarewelcomeatmytable, is a brand focused on inclusivity in gaming, both tabletop and digital. Distributed print-on-demand by Threadless, all profits currently go directly to either Black Lives Matter, The Trevor Project, or the ACLU (depending on design purchased.)</p>
