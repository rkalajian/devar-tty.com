# OTHELLO EXAULT/SIN Open Beta Test

<img src="/assets/images/OTHELLO-EXAULT-SIN-Beta/cover-square.jpg" alt="OTHELLO Cover"/>
<br/>
OTHELLO: EXAULT/SIN is a narrative, sci-fi, horror RPG where players take the roles of EXAULTED in a space station infected with an unknown entity called SIN.

The following rules are presented in an unfinished state for open beta testing. I hope you enjoy the game, and I look foward to your feedback. I've set up a section on the [You Are Welcome At My Table Discord](https://discord.gg/PRjtw9B) for people to post their experiences so I may tweak the game before its final release.

This page will serve as the main hub for the beta best, and will contain all future updates over the course of the testing period.
