<br/>
otHELLo: EXAULT/SIN is a narrative, sci-fi, horror RPG where players take the roles of EXAULTED in a space station infected with an unknown entity called SIN. This is the first game using the SIN System I've been developing.

The following rules are presented in an unfinished state for open beta testing. I hope you enjoy the game, and I look foward to your feedback. Feedback can be sent to rkalajian [at] gmail.com.
