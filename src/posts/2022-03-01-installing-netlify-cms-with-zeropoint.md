I finally got around to adding [Netlfiy CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) to the site, allowing me to easily create new blog posts from the web using a minimal editor and all the custom fields I use in my posts.

Now, setting up Netlfiy CMS with [ZeroPoint](https://github.com/MWDelaney/ZeroPoint) is a tad different than doing so with a straight [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) install, so let me document the process here for those looking to do the same.

Before doing anything, Netlify users must make sure to [enable Identity](https://app.netlify.com/sites/lucid-nobel-dab1f7/settings/identity), adding GitHub as an external authentican service and enabling Git Gateway.

With that taken care of, open your **.eleventy.js** file in the root of your Zeropoint install, scroll to the bottom, and modify your *templateFormats* to incluse both html and yml files.

<pre class="code-block">
`templateFormats: ['njk', 'md', '11ty.js', 'yml', 'html'],`
</pre>

With that out of the way, create an **admin** folder under the **src** folder and create two files: **config.yml** and **index.html**.

**config.yml contents:**

<pre class="code-block">
``backend:
   name: git-gateway
   branch: master # Branch to update (optional; defaults to master)
media_folder: "src/assets/images/uploads"
public_folder: "assets/images/uploads"
collections:
- name: "post" # Used in routes, e.g., /admin/collections/blog
label: "Post" # Used in the UI
folder: "src/posts" # The path to the folder where the documents are stored
create: true # Allow users to create new documents in this collection
slug: "{{year}}-{{month}}-{{day}}-{{slug}}" # Filename template, e.g., YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
fields: # The fields for each document, usually in front matter
- {label: "Layout", name: "layout", widget: "hidden", default: "post"}
- {label: "Title", name: "title", widget: "string"}
- {label: "Publish Date", name: "date", widget: "datetime"}
- {label: "Featured Image", name: "featuredImage", widget: "image"}
- {label: "Tags", name: "tags", widget: "list"}
- {label: "Body", name: "body", widget: "markdown"}` ``
</pre>

**index.html contents:**

<pre class="code-block">
`<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
   <meta charset="utf-8" />
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
   <title>Devar-TTY Content Manager</title>
   <script src="https://identity.netlify.com/v1/netlify-identity-widget.js"> .  </script>`

`</head>
<body>
   <!-- Include the script that builds the page and powers Netlify CMS -->
   <script src="https://unpkg.com/netlify-cms@^2.0.0/dist/netlify-cms.js"></script>
</body>
</html>`
</pre>

The config.yml file is where you'll set the paths for both the source and public image locations for your site. After that you'll be setting up the \[collections](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/collection-types/) for the CMS to display. In my example above you can see that I've got fields for the post layout, the title, the publish date, a featured image, tags, and, of course, the post body.

Once these files are all set, the final step is to add the following to **/src/assets/views/layouts/base.njk**, just before the end of the *</head>* tag:

<pre class="code-block">
`<script src="https://identity.netlify.com/v1/netlify-identity-widget.js"></script>`\
</pre>

As well as the following before the </body> tag:

<pre class="code-block">
`<script>
if (window.netlifyIdentity) {
   window.netlifyIdentity.on("init", user => {
      if (!user) {
         window.netlifyIdentity.on("login", () => {
            document.location.href = "/admin/";
         });
      }
   });
}
</script>`\
</pre>


All that's left at this point is to build your site and hit /admin on your production URL!
