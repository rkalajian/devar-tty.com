The Atari VCS hit the console scene for the mass market in mid-2021, boasting powerful hardware and an e-shop filled with retro Atari games and a handful of modern titles. Unfortunately, it was not entirely clear at first who the primary audience of the console was, and while it has gotten a bit clearer, the system is still surprisingly deceptive.

## Just Scratching the Surface
At first glance, the Atari VCS looks like many other micro consoles that have come before it. A quick look at the device and one might, incorrectly, believe the system to be Atari's answer to the NES Classic Console or possibly another OUYA-type device. Once booted up, players find a menu containing some retro Atari titles, an eShop, Chrome, and little more.

The retro Atari titles play true to form and feel even better with the optional old-school-style Atari controller. More titles are purchasable from the eShop, and the be completely honest, they are well worth the money for anyone who grew up with an Atari in their household at some point. In addition, the selection of more modern titles gives the system a good foothold for many gamers to get hours of enjoyment out of the console.

In the end, though, does this make the Atari VCS worth $300+?

No.

Thankfully, the system has way more to offer.

## Under the Hood

The Atari VCS boasts impressive hardware under the hood, unlike many other micro consoles that perform as expected and come at a lower price. The VCS has the following hardware specs:

* 14nm AMD R1606G Zen processor with 2 cores and 4 threads
  * 2.6 GHz (400 model)
  * 3.5 GHz (600 model)
* Upgradeable Memory
  * 8 GB DDR4 (800 model)
  * 4 GB DDR4 (400 model)
* Radeon Vega 3 APU architecture with up to 4GB of memory
* 32GB Internal Flash Memory
* An internal M2 slot for an SSH hard drive
* The capability to use external USB storage
* Wifi and Gigabit Ethernet
* Bluetooth 5.0

It runs a custom Ubuntu Linux operating system and can enter "PC Mode," where users can install Linux, Windows, or Chrome OS onto the device.

## The Atari VCS as A Mini PC
Running the Atari VCS and a mini PC offers users a surprisingly robust PC at an affordable price. Windows runs smoothly, whether using productivity software or many indie games (and even some more modern titles,) while Linux and Chrome OS perform at a level many $300 PCs cannot.

The unit sent over for review is currently running as a Windows PC for an 8-year-old and 11-year old to enjoy Steam games and work on Unity development.

## Developer's Delight
Developers looking to create on the platform can easily do so with Unity, completing Linux applications and submitting them to Atari for revenue sharing on the eShop. There is even an avenue for homebrew gaming on the VCS coming soon.

## Verdict

The Atari VCS may initially look like an overpriced retro micro-console. While it performs that function quite well, the VCS is a powerful PC with so much more capability under its hood than many would expect at first glance.

The system is an excellent throwback to the Atari systems of old, but it is also a great beginner PC, hobbyist console, and development platform.
