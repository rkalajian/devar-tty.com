Fantasy Life Online has been out for a few months now, with several new 5-Star characters joining the roster at an accelerated rate compared to the Japanese run of the game. The following tier list only looks at 5-Star characters, as there is really no need to compare characters that are 4-Star or lower.

What is important to know about these tier lists is that all of these characters and weapons will outperform any of their lower star counterparts. Players looking to min-max their team compositions can use this list to do so, but casual players who enjoy playing as their favorite characters and weapons will have no issue completing story quests, Crusade Missions, or other events.

This list will change from month to month as the game is updated and new characters are released.
