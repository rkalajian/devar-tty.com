First introduced in Fortnite Chapter 2, Season 2, the original Midas was only available to players who reached Level 100 in the Battle Pass. Since then there have been 4 variations of the character released, one available in The Last Laugh Pack, two available for V-Bucks, and one available in a special cash bundle. While each of the Midas skins available are amazing, some are certainly better than others. Here is a quick ranking of Midas and his variations.

## \#6 - Midsummer Midas

Realeased on June 24th, 2021 for 1,600 V-Bucks during Fortnite Chapter 2, Season 7, Midsummer Midas is a playful variation of the character that can be customized with reactive gold tattoos, a jacket, and sunglasses. A great skin overall, but it lacks the menacing feel usually associated with Midas.

## \#5 - Midas Rex

Midas Rex is a heavily armored version of Midas that was released on November 17th, 2020 as part of the $30 Last Laugh Bundle. An odd choice to release with the Joker and Poison Ivy, Midas Rex has a removable helmet and not much else in common with the other Midas skins availabe in Fortnite.

## \#4 - Icebound Midas

The newest Midas skin, Icebound Midas, arrived in Chapter 3, Season 1 on December 22nd, 2021. Part of the Frozen Series, this version of Midas could only be purchased for V-Bucks as part of the Black Ice Set that also included Permafrost Raider and Ice Crystal, along with several accessories for each character. The coolest (pun intended) part of Icebound Midas is that he freezes every weapon he holds instead of turning them to gold.

## \#3 - Shadow Midas

Shadow Midas, not to be confused with the unlockable Shadow style for the original Midas, came out on October 29th, 2021 as part of Fortnitemares 2021. Available for 1,500 V-Bucks, this was the first Midas skin released for V-Bucks that had a strong resemblance to the original skin. Instead of turning gold, Shadow Midas glows more and more purple with each elimination a player makes.

## \#2 - Midas

When it comes to Midas skins it is hard to compete with the original. A classy villain with the ability to turn any weapon he touches to gold, players could even unlock more styles for him by overlevelling their Battle Pass, including the ability to turn him gold. There is just something about the pale skin, gold tattoos, and the formal clothing that just ressonates with Fortnite fans.

## \#1 - Marigold

Marigold is a fan concept turned reality when Fortogrpaher Kitsu imagined what a female Midas would look like. Marigold would end up joining the Fortnite ranks on March 9th, 2021 during Fortnite Chapter 2, Season 7. She is the third "Midas" skin to release, and the first to work similarly to the original Midas. Marigold can turn weapons gold, and is reactive, slowly turning more and more gold as players rack up eliminations. Marigold is only available as part of an $11.99 bundle that includes:

* Marigold
* Golden Daggers Pickaxe
* Golden Gambit Back Bling
* Challenges to earn 1,500 V-Bucks
