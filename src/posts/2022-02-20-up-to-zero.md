Over the past week I've been working on transitioning my site from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) hosted on GitHub Pages to [ZeroPoint](https://github.com/MWDelaney/ZeroPoint) on Netlify. ZeroPoint is a framework built on [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator similar to Jeykll that feels a lot more powerful and takes great advantage of the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/).

Pretty much all of this site's original functionality is there,and  I'm working on as a proof-of-concept to get more familiar with 11ty and how it handles data sources, among other things.

There are few other projects I'm hoping to work on now that I'm running ZeroPoint, including ones that incorporate both my love of gaming and the development of the [SIN System](/othello-exault-sin/).
