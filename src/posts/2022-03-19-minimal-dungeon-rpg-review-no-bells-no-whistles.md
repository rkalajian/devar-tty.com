Minimal Dungeon RPG is exactly what it sounds like on the surface, an RPG devoid of what makes up most modern RPGs. Dungeons are abstracted, and players must worry more about their stats than anything else. Nevertheless, it's an entertaining little game that is enough to keep players busy for a time, though it does get a bit weary over time.

## Clickity Clack

Expect to click *a lot* in Minimal Dungeon RPG. Players with Carpal Tunnel or other RSIs of the hand/arms are probably best avoiding it. Instead of walking around a world map, interacting with NPCs and fighting monsters in beautifually animated sequences, the game abracts dungeons and towns into squares that are interacted with by clicking on them.

Exploration, Wood, Stone, Fishing, and other exploration-based tiles must be clicked until their progress bar fills, using AP points for every click. Monsters work similarly but consider a player's HP, ATK, and DEF that determine if a monster can be conquered or if more levelling is needed. There is no death in the game, but players must be able to defeat a monster before their HP, and then their ATK/DEF, reaches zero. If these stats do reach zero, players must wait a time until they refill, based on the RCV value.

## Get Buff

As players progress through Minimal Dungeon RPG, they will gain levels to boost their stats as they choose. Different equipment is used to boots stats further. There are many swords, armor, boots, and rings, each with a different rarity and level requirement, that can provide a powerful stat boost, or other buffs. Fruit can also be found/grown and offered up at different altars found throughout the game for even more stat boosts.

If players get stuck during the main story, they can use Shards found or purchased to replay through previous levels at varying difficulties to get stronger, similar to the standard RPG grind.

## A Tale to Tell

Minimal Dungeon RPGs story is just as light as the rest of the game, though not in a bad way. As players follow the main story they can also suppliment their journey with the unlockable Lost Ruins. It is enough to keep the pace of the game and keep players grinding through level after level to see what happens.

## Verdict

Overall, Minimal Dungeon RPG is a cute RPG that gives players enough of an entertaining experience to justify the $9.99 price tag. It does get a bit stale after a while, and most players will probably tire of the game before its completion, but at least they will have gotten the game's price worth of fun out of it by then.
